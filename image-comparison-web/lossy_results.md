#Lossy metrics

For each comparison algorithms, we plot the quality in dB in function of the mean bits per pixel on a logarithmic scale. We can then visualize which codec gives the best quality at a given bit per pixel (top left is better).

##Bits per pixel at equivalent quality according to VMAF

Please note that VMAF is more suitable as a video codec comparison tool, not an image one.
